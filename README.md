# TCIrecscan

TCIrecscan.sh is a bash script that automates the process of performing an insane reconnaissance scan on a target domain. It utilizes various tools like Nmap, Gobuster, Nikto, and WhatWeb to gather information about open ports, directories, and vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Nmap: Install Nmap from https://nmap.org/
- Gobuster: Install Gobuster from https://github.com/OJ/gobuster
- Nikto: Install Nikto from https://github.com/sullo/nikto
- WhatWeb: Install WhatWeb from https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the TCIrecscan.sh script.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x TCIrecscan.sh`
3. Run the script with the target domain as an argument: `./TCIrecscan.sh <Domain>`

Example: `./TCIrecscan.sh example.com`

## Explanation of the Script

The script is divided into several sections and performs the following steps:

1. It defines color codes for formatting the output and a function to print the script's banner.
2. It prompts for the target domain and creates an output directory.
3. It runs Nmap to find open ports and saves the results in `open_ports.txt`.
4. It runs Nmap again using the gathered open ports and performs a comprehensive scan, saving the vulnerabilities in `vulnerabilities.txt`.
5. It runs Gobuster to find directories using the common wordlist `dirb/common.txt` and saves the results in `directories.txt`.
6. It runs Nikto to scan for vulnerabilities and saves the detailed report in `nikto_report.txt`. It extracts the vulnerabilities from the report and appends them to `vulnerabilities.txt`.
7. It runs WhatWeb to scan for vulnerabilities and saves the detailed report in `whatweb_report.txt`. It extracts the vulnerabilities from the report and appends them to `vulnerabilities.txt`.
8. It displays a completion message.

## Output

The script generates the following files in the output directory:

- `open_ports.txt`: Contains a list of open ports found on the target domain.
- `vulnerabilities.txt`: Contains a list of vulnerabilities identified by Nmap, Nikto, and WhatWeb.
- `directories.txt`: Contains a list of directories discovered by Gobuster.
- `nikto_report.txt`: Contains the detailed report generated by Nikto.
- `whatweb_report.txt`: Contains the detailed report generated by WhatWeb.
